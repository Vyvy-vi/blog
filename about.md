Hey, I'm Vyvy-vi
{:center}

I'm a student, who likes to contribute to creating a more considerate behaviour in the way people can get help on online forums and a huge believer in opensource software.
Mostly, I work with Python, however I have been trying to expand my knowledge and experience to other areas are well.

I love working on Chatbots and Automations :)

This blog is mainly writen for an audience of one - _Me_, however, if anyone else does see this blog and have any recommendations or suggestions, feel free to raise an issue on the [github-repo](https://github.com/Vyvy-vi/blog/issues) for this blog. Some extra thoughts I have while making the blog is that maybe some other devs could find the content in here useful or insightful and could potentially help people, or maybe give them a view into how I process things.
