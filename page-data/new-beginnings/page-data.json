Here’s my blog and I don’t really know how to start it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about writing one for almost a year; even drafted a few posts, but never got around to completing them or posting them.\nHave you ever had that feeling: that surge of inspiration and determination you get when you decide to pick up something that interests you, but all that fades away as any time you try to do it, it isn’t perfect as you’d like it to be?</p>\n<p>Yes, that’s me with most things. And I really need to change. I’ve decided to use this blog as my <strong>accountability ledger</strong> and to keep trying to get things done instead of trying to get things done the <em>right way</em>. Idk how many people are gonna read this, but writing down things in a ranty-conversational format seems like a good reality check for future-me and if reading these blog posts helps someone else, I’d be really happy, even if it’s just for an audience of 1.</p>\n<h2>What made me want to change things?</h2>\n<p>I’ve been a member of many online communities for the past 2 years and I’ve noticed how much people have grown and I’m very inspired by people who are trying so many new things in a more public and open atmosphere, working to break into tech, while helping so many people that are just starting out. Many of them have made massive leaps and have moved on to do great things. I want to be like them. I want to be more open to trying new things and learn, grow, and share on a more public platform.</p>\n<p>I’m quite introverted and I’ve always refrained from speaking in public, even though my diction and pronunciation haven’t ever been bad. It’s more like an ‘inertia of confidence’: I’ve never been comfortable about speaking in public, so I’ve never done it. In the past year, I’ve been participating not only in speaking at public-speaking events, but also organising and moderating such sessions at <a href=\"https://www.eddiehub.org/\">EddieHub</a>: My favourite open source community. These sessions provided a safe-space where I could engage in conversation with other people without worrying about every little detail that can go wrong.</p>\n<p>Recently, I was selected to participate in the <a href=\"https://www.eddiehub.org/ambassador-program\">EddieHub Ambassador programme</a>, and I’m just delighted by how the program is intended to nudge and support the ambassadors to become more engaged in content creation and community development. All the advice that Eddie, Sara and the other Ambassadors have shared has given me a better idea about how I can embark on this journey, and I feel greatful for the extra accountability that I can start complying with.</p>\n<h2>Things I want to do in what remains of this year (2022)</h2>\n<p>This is certainly not an exhaustive list, and may keep growing in size as time passes, but I think it’s a good place to start.</p>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled> Teach a programming concept to a group of people.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Host a Twitter Space.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Make a Tutorial video or a Casual programming video that is longer than 5 minutes.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Write a blog post on “why working with microprocessors can be interesting for a CS student”.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Write a blog post on “why many student communities need an attitude change”</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Write a blog post roughly every month.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Write a blog post on my developer-journey so far.</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Bring back my old discord bot project -
